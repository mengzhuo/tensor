// There are times where it is more effective to use native Go slice semantics to do work (for example, when performing batch work over kernels).

// The NativeSelect function squashes the dimensions, and returns an iterator in native Go slice semantics.
func Example_select() {
	// Selection is a bit of an interesting use case. Sometimes you don't want to iterate through the layers.
	//
	// For example, in a number of use cases where you have a 4-Tensor, you'd typically reshape it to some
	// 2D matrix which can then be plugged into BLAS algorithms directly. Sometimes you wouldn't need to reshape.
	// All you have to do is squash the dimensions inwards. This function does that.
	//
	// The best way to explain the Select functions is through concrete examples.
	// Imagine a tensor with (2,3,4,5) shape. Arbitrarily, we call them (NCHW) - Batch Size, Channel Count, Height, Width.
	// If we want to select all the channels, across all batches, then `NativeSelectX(T, 1)` would yield all channels. The resulting matrix will be (6, 20)
	// If we want to select all the heights, across all channels and batches, then `NativeSelectX(T, 2) will yield all heights. The resulting matrix will be (24, 5)
	//
	// If for some reason the format was in NHWC, then you would need to reshape. This wouldn't be useful.
